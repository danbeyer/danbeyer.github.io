				<p>I have always been fascinated with computers, even from a very early age.  Some of my fondest memories growing up were of my brother, myself, and my dad
				sitting around our old MS DOS PC and trying out new shareware games and programs.  I always figured I would end up with a career in technology focusing on computer science.
				These plans took a back seat while I attended the University of Minnesota Medical School where I gained first hand clinical experience with the myriad of new healthcare IT solutions 
				that have recently come on the market.  I now work as a Health Informatics consultant for Rain Resources.  I provide at the elbow training and support to physicians and other healthcare 
				providers during their healthcare organization's transition to the EPIC Electronic Health Records system.  In assisting hospitals and clinics across the country in their adoption of this 
				EHR system, I am in the unique position of having experience both as a healthcare provider from my time at the University of Minnesota, and experience in software development from the 
				Computer Science degree program I am enrolled in at Oregon State University.  I anticipate graduating in December 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science from Oregon State University, and in doing so I hope to fulfill
				my original plan of working in the computer science field.</p>
